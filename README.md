Hello, dt-jb here.
I'm learning to code- starting with HTML/CSS and into JavaScript.  I have a tiny bit of experience with code Java in High School (not what I would call real experience, but have seen code before albeit EXTREMELY simple) and Matlab in engineering school.  The latter was usually just a vehicle for calculation of complex systems problems, where we were largely executing and slightly altering code that had already been generated for an example case.  

Anyway, I look forward to learning more.
